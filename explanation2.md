# Project Explanation

## Overview

This project aims to provision and configure an environment using both Terraform and Ansible. The primary goal is to set up a similar infrastructure stack as was created in stage 1, using Vagrant for server provisioning and Docker for containerization. The project is divided into multiple stages for better organization and scalability.

## Project Structure

The directory structure for the project is as follows:

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `Vagrant`, `VirtualBox`, `Git`, and `Ansible` installed on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Step 2: Checkout to Stage Two
Checkout to the Stage_two branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b Stage_two
Step 3: Create Directory for Stage Two
Create a new directory inside stage-1-Ansible-root named after the branch:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p stage-1-Ansible-root/Stage_two
Step 4: Navigate to the Directory
Navigate to the newly created directory:

bash
Copy code
cd stage-1-Ansible-root/Stage_two
Step 5: Run Vagrant
Initialize and start your Vagrant environment:

bash
Copy code
vagrant up
Step 6: Run Ansible Playbooks
Navigate to the ansible directory and run the playbooks to set up the environment:

bash
Copy code
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
Playbooks
common_setup.yml: Installs Docker and Docker Compose, ensures the Docker service is running, and adds the vagrant user to the docker group.
backend_setup.yml: Clones the backend repository, checks for the presence of docker-compose.yml, and starts the backend Docker service.
frontend_setup.yml: Clones the frontend repository, checks for the presence of docker-compose.yml, and starts the frontend Docker service.
Inventory
The inventory file contains the host definitions and their corresponding connection details. Ensure that the SSH keys and passwords are correctly configured to allow Ansible to connect to the hosts.

Roles
common: Contains tasks common to both backend and frontend, such as installing Docker.
backend: Contains tasks specific to setting up the backend service.
frontend: Contains tasks specific to setting up the frontend service.
Troubleshooting
Ensure SSH access to the Vagrant machines is working. You might need to update the SSH keys or passwords in the inventory file.
If you encounter issues with the apt package manager, make sure the repositories are correctly configured and accessible.
Verify the structure and paths within the Ansible playbooks to ensure they match your project’s file system.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively use Vagrant for provisioning, and Ansible for configuration management and deployment, to create a consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup. By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to set up a backend and frontend environment using Docker containers, managed through Ansible.
